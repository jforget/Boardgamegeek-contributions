This directory contains a text containing translation
tips and advices. I initially wrote this text in 1996
and I updated it regularly until 2000. Then I left
this text for 25 years. In 2025, I converted it into
Markdown and I updated it.

There is only a French version, because this text requires
a good mastery of the language. I cannot pretend I am
proficient enough in English to write an English version.
