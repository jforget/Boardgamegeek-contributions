\begin{document}

Scenarios are identified by the page number, a dash and a
sequential number to distinguish scenarios in the same page. If
a scenario is printed on several pages, the first page is used for
the scenario code. For example, \textit{One Against Many} is printed
on pages 52 and 53, therefore its code is 52-4.

When a person, location, etc is directly involved in a scenario,
the scenario code is typeset in upright characters. If the scenario
includes just an indirect mention of this person or location,
its code is typeset in italics. This may include Max Immelmann, Raoul Lufbery
and John Thach if the eponymous aerobatic maneuver or the eponymous
tactics are mentionned.

\section*{Aircraft Types}

The index includes the scenario variations and the encounter
tables for mission scenarios, with a ``V'' or an ``E''
suffix. Aircraft types are listed here only if they do not appear in the
scenario main description.

\section*{Errata}

Here are a few errata from the scenarios. Not something that can ruin a game, just
a few typos.

% Inconsistent use of dashes in aircraft types, for example ``Bf 109G6''
% instead of  ``Bf 109G-6'': various places.

=head1 Description

This  document  gives  an  index  of proper  names  mentioned  in  the
scenarios of I<Achtung Spitfire!>. These proper names are separated in
two categories.  The first  category is  persons. The  second category
mixes locations (e.g.  Kurksk) and events (e.g. Battle  of Kursk). The
third category includes  units and the fourth  category lists aircraft
types.

This  document includes  also  a  few errata  I  have  spotted in  the
scenario booklet.
