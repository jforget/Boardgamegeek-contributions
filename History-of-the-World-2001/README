The rules describing capitals and cities, the rules
governing the use of coins, and the rules describing
special cases for combat are scattered over the
rule booklet, plus the event cards. This play aid aims
at gathering these rules into three comprehensive paragraphs.

Exists in French.

If you want to translate into another language, you
can contact me. You will need:
-- some patience (I do not read my geekmail every day),
-- a working installation of luatex on your computer,
-- the English or French source file (in this directory),
-- very basic knowledge of TEX,
-- some knowledge of LATEX (a bit more than TEX, but still basic),
-- some rather good knowledge of METAPOST,
-- knowledge of lua is not required.

The LuaLATEX files are licensed under the GPL.
