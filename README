I have recently submitted a few files to Boardgamegeek.
These files are PDF files, built by some programs.
This repository stores the programs that I used
to build the PDF files.

These files are licensed under some free software license,
so you can reuse my programs, tweak them and build your
onw version of the PDF files.
